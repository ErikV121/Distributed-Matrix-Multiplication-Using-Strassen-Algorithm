# Distributed Matrix Multiplication Using Strassen's Algorithm

## Version Comparison

### V1
- Implemented basic Strassen's algorithm on a single PC
- Fixed due to readability and maintainability issues
- Successfully performed matrix multiplication but lacked scalability

### V2 (Current)
- Major refactoring for improved code readability
- Better structure with separation of concerns
- More modular design for easier maintenance
- **Planned Improvements:**
    - Dynamic workload allocation based on available worker nodes
    - Improved performance through parallel processing

## Project Status
V2 is currently under development... While more structured and readable than V1, the distributed 
implementation of Strassen's algorithm across multiple computers is still being implemented.
